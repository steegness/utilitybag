Useful functions I keep writing and re-writing and want to stop with that

## UbuntuSetupSteps.sh
This is a bash script to get a new ubuntu+php container up and running how I currently like it.  It is primed to work with the containers on CodeAnywhere.com, but with minimal tweaks could be made to work elsewhere.

It creates a folder structure (which can be altered so multiple versions of a project can live on the same box), installs node/npm, and then installs a handful of packages.  It will then create a couple of files, including the default gulp taskrunner.

## utility.php
PHP file with useful utility functions.

## utility.js
JavaScript file with useful utility functions.
